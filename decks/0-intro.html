# Why?

- 28% of MITx MOOC students self-identify as educators<sup>1</sup>
- We get many requests from educators to use MITx:
	- in their own courses
	- with their own students

# Why not SPOCs?

We have done this before, but SPOCs:
	
- are too hard to set up
- require too much training
- allow content modifications

# What is a CCX?

Delegated educators ("coaches") can:
	
- adjust start dates & end dates
- select a subset of material from the MOOC
- invite & administer a *small* group of students
- view and download grades for their group of students
